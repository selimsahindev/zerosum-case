 * !!IMPORTANT!!
 * * If you are new to this kind of projects, similar games are all over the market and successful examples can be reached easily.
 * * Yes, we want you to create a game but that's not it. Given instruction are just for basics of this project, so don't stop there.
 * * We want you to look from user's perspective and use your creative side. We are excited see your vision about the big picture.
 * * Use your imagination to create VFXs for actions in the game (including shaders).
 * * End product must be visually pleasing.
 * * Camera movements will be considered. 
 * * It's better to creating your own way but if you are comfortable with any third party tool or package,
 * you can use them in your game, of course with an explanation about the reason that you are using it.
 * * You can create your own levels but it's ok if you get templates from similar games.
 * * If you are feeling limited with animations, don't forget you have your character's model in t-pose.
 * * If you are feeling limited with models, don't hesitate about modifying them or you can always generate your own.
 * * If you are feeling limited with sprites, don't forget you can use sprite editor.
 * * If you are feeling limited with base texture colors, you can define your own colors.
 * * Feel free to make any kind of improvement.
 *
 * Project should be delivered in a week.
